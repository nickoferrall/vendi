        question: 'Do I need to use OTAs?',
        answer:
          "While OTAs are very expensive, they are the primary way that travellers book their accommodation. Hostels with a large presence can attract customers directly to their website and avoid commissions but this is very difficult for a new hostel."

        question: 'How to accept credit cards in Colombia?',
        answer: "There are a few different options. It is possible to get a point of sale (POS) from local banks such as Davivienda and Bancolombia. However, the process is time consuming, very difficult if you're not Colombian and whilie the fees vary, they're usually expensive. Tab is a US start-up that operates in Colombia. They help tourist businesses take payments online, in-person and charge no-shows. They charge a 2.9% fee to the business. PayPal is an option for online payments and they're obviously well known. However, their fees are 8.9% + $0.30 when you factor in currency conversion in Colombia."
