It’s the perfect district for anyone looking to experience this city like a local. It is actually a sprawling set of neighborhoods that consist of university students, a considerably large and influential LGBTQ community, a thriving financial district, and artistic bohemian restaurants, bars, and shops. It boasts impressive modern and contemporary brick designs that blend with the general colonial aesthetic. Some of the most impressive designs demonstrate curved profiles and stepped balconies that were initially designed for lower income families, but are now home to Colombia’s elite. Chapinero, Colombia is the place to experience if you want to know what it’s like to be a Colombian in the 21st century.\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"description":{"description":"Selina Chapinero Bogotá offers a restaurant and bar, free WiFi and a CoWorking Space.
