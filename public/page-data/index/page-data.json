and if you need oil, salt, pepper, sugar, toothpaste, soap ….. either bring it with you or it will be for sale – Our prices are fair and reasonable\n\nThere is no strict rule about check in and check out, just that one night payment gives you a 24 hour access\nIf you plan to arrive with the 6 AM jeep, spend the day, the night, stay the next day and catch a night bus then there will be an extra charge added\n\nAll proceeds go to the Mystic Banana Fundacion – The Simple Life, dedicated to living a more sustainable life, mind, body and soul while exploring and experimenting with our own
