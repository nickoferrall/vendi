and if you need oil, salt, pepper, sugar, toothpaste, soap ….. either bring it with you or it will be for sale – Our prices are fair and reasonable\n\nThere is no strict rule about check in and check out, just that one night payment gives you a 24 hour access\nIf you plan to arrive with the 6 AM jeep, spend the day, the night, stay the next day and catch a night bus then there will be an extra charge added\n\nAll proceeds go to the Mystic Banana Fundacion – The Simple Life, dedicated to living a more sustainable life, mind, body and soul while exploring and experimenting with our own

The property offers a 24 Hour Front Desk.Hotel Aragón walls have witnessed many distinguished guests such as Isabel Martínez de Perón (President of Argentina, 1974-76, third wife of Juan Domingo Perón). Isabel Martínez de Perón lived in this hotel in the fifties, at that time she was a dancer. And Fidel Castro himself when he was 21 years old came to Bogotá in April 1948 to attend the Latin Americas Congress of youth, and happened to be here just during El Bogotazo, an uprising of people after Jorge Eliécer Gaitán (Presidential candidate was shot in the street). In those days the name of the hotel was 'Crillon'."},"facilities":null,"image":[{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7612359550561798,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/2fbhClEKUi6m6rRkRxGnNp/dcea957fb4aa8ac02246df217ee53a6f/Screenshot_97.jpg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/2fbhClEKUi6m6rRkRxGnNp/dcea957fb4aa8ac02246df217ee53a6f/Screenshot_97.jpg?w=200&h=114&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/2fbhClEKUi6m6rRkRxGnNp/dcea957fb4aa8ac02246df217ee53a6f/Screenshot_97.jpg?w=400&h=227&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/2fbhClEKUi6m6rRkRxGnNp/dcea957fb4aa8ac02246df217ee53a6f/Screenshot_97.jpg?w=627&h=356&q=50 627w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}]}},{"node":{"id":"79e7b8e0-2a2f-5eb5-a9eb-8b6529fbc3a6","slug":"rua-116","forSale":false,"hostelName":"Rua 116","city":"Bogota","country":"Colombia","price":null,"longDescription":{"json":{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"The property is located in an alley, which can be reached from the Carrera 6a, being the alley the second if coming from the South (or the nearby shopping mall), or the first alley if coming from the North (if coming from the nearby main square).

The buildings are beautiful and the streets are safe and pedestrian friendly.\n\nWe’ve got an array of accommodation options for every budget. Stay in our dormitories, standard, private, or single rooms. Deluxe and family rooms also available.\n\nChapinero, Bogota is an affluent, urban Colombian neighborhood set between Calle 39, Avenida Caracas, Calle 100, and the Eastern Hills. It’s the perfect district for anyone looking to experience this city like a local. It is actually a sprawling set of neighborhoods that consist of university students, a considerably large and influential LGBTQ community, a thriving financial district, and artistic bohemian restaurants, bars, and shops. It boasts impressive modern and contemporary brick designs that blend with the general colonial aesthetic. Some of the most impressive designs demonstrate curved profiles and stepped balconies that were initially designed for lower income families, but are now home to Colombia’s elite. Chapinero, Colombia is the place to experience if you want to know what it’s like to be a Colombian in the 21st century.\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"description":{"description":"Selina Chapinero Bogotá offers a restaurant and bar, free WiFi and a CoWorking Space.
