and if you need oil, salt, pepper, sugar, toothpaste, soap ….. either bring it with you or it will be for sale – Our prices are fair and reasonable\n\nThere is no strict rule about check in and check out, just that one night payment gives you a 24 hour access\nIf you plan to arrive with the 6 AM jeep, spend the day, the night, stay the next day and catch a night bus then there will be an extra charge added\n\nAll proceeds go to the Mystic Banana Fundacion – The Simple Life, dedicated to living a more sustainable life, mind, body and soul while exploring and experimenting with our own

In this place it is said that the indigenous leader of the Muiscas could observe the whole sheet at its width and length, in this place Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada founded the city and was born the capital city of Colombia, Bogotá.\n\nIn the surroundings of La Candelaria, you will find the best Walking tours and Graffiti tours, with which you can explore the area in 2 or 3 hours exploring the most beautiful places and murals you have ever seen. In the neighborhood you will find many of the museums available in the city, where you can appreciate the history of our country in all the known eras, from the magnificent Gold Museum passing through the Vase Museum, Botero Museum, Museo Quinta Bolivar and others . You will also find the Cerro Monserrate, where you can take a two-hour walk to reach its peak or you can take the cable car if the sport is not your strong point. Outside the house you will be fascinated by the street culture, along with its artists and sporadic events. And so I could continue for many more lines, but when this takes out we can talk more calmly.\n\nAs a small sample, I tell you that we offer ecological walks to the waterfall La Chorrera, to the paramo of Sumapaz and Chingaza, exits to Guatavita and Zipaquirá. For lovers of cycling, we have the Bike Tour, a tour that lasts about 4 hours and where you can see more distant places in the city. For lovers of the night, in the city we have a place called Zona Rosa, where you can find the best clubs, bars and restaurants in the city, and that's where all the people go to celebrate, dance and enjoy.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"description":{"description":"I'm going to tell you a secret, pay attention.

Additionally, we have convenient access to the growing yet still authentically Colombian sector of Envigado either by foot, taxi, or bus. And if you happen to stay with us over the weekend, don’t forget to take advantage of a “ciclovía,” in which the south-bound lanes of the beautiful Avenida Poblado (located almost next to the hostel) are blocked off to traffic and filled with walkers, joggers, bikers, and the occasional rollerblader.
