The lovely home was created by two world travellers and avid lovers of good coffee. Our life-philosophy is firmly grounded in the belief that everyone deserves to be happy and seek to share it, that’s why we help shape memorable experiences around travel and coffee. Our project is located in a beautiful structure that mixes colonial architecture with a rustic style. In-door gardens and open spaces accentuate the space. The large patio with hammocks and fruit trees are ideal for unwinding after a long day of exploration, sharing stories, enjoying some of the beverages from the house, practicing yoga, reading or any other outdoor hobby. Our café as a common area, is the ultimate space for those digital nomads and freelance professionals who are looking for a place with excellent wifi, good music and above all, the best Colombian coffee!"},"facilities":null,"image":[{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7321428571428572,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/6bQi3PYpXo5MvqgVufCsI5/3b578755be7e297c91f1d09881040cf8/Screenshot_137.jpg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/6bQi3PYpXo5MvqgVufCsI5/3b578755be7e297c91f1d09881040cf8/Screenshot_137.jpg?w=200&h=115&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/6bQi3PYpXo5MvqgVufCsI5/3b578755be7e297c91f1d09881040cf8/Screenshot_137.jpg?w=400&h=231&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/6bQi3PYpXo5MvqgVufCsI5/3b578755be7e297c91f1d09881040cf8/Screenshot_137.jpg?w=800&h=462&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/6bQi3PYpXo5MvqgVufCsI5/3b578755be7e297c91f1d09881040cf8/Screenshot_137.jpg?w=873&h=504&q=50 873w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"padma-house"}}}
