If you are going to start your trip, to finish it, or maybe just to be in step, you will want to feel happy, excited, expectant to meet new people, to live new experiences, to feel the world, to be free, to be a traveler. Casa Bellavista is the perfect place for your trip and even more for you, the atmosphere is incredible, in our house you can get to know Colombia, our family, as friendly and warm as our people, our mascot (Maya) a little dog who receives everyone as if he knew them for centuries. Anyway, in Casa Bellavista you will be another Colombian, that's why in our house we are all willing to help you and guide you in everything you need. Are you willing to discover it? If your answer is yes, please continue. If your answer is no, come and we will show you the opposite.\n\nWe are located in the Plaza del Chorro de Quevedo, in La Calendaria, one of the most emblematic neighborhoods of the city for its history and incredible cultural tessitura. In this place it is said that the indigenous leader of the Muiscas could observe the whole sheet at its width and length, in this place Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada founded the city and was born the capital city of Colombia, Bogotá.\n\nIn the surroundings of La Candelaria, you will find the best Walking tours and Graffiti tours, with which you can explore the area in 2 or 3 hours exploring the most beautiful places and murals you have ever seen. In the neighborhood you will find many of the museums available in the city, where you can appreciate the history of our country in all the known eras, from the magnificent Gold Museum passing through the Vase Museum, Botero Museum, Museo Quinta Bolivar and others . You will also find the Cerro Monserrate, where you can take a two-hour walk to reach its peak or you can take the cable car if the sport is not your strong point. Outside the house you will be fascinated by the street culture, along with its artists and sporadic events. And so I could continue for many more lines, but when this takes out we can talk more calmly.\n\nAs a small sample, I tell you that we offer ecological walks to the waterfall La Chorrera, to the paramo of Sumapaz and Chingaza, exits to Guatavita and Zipaquirá. For lovers of cycling, we have the Bike Tour, a tour that lasts about 4 hours and where you can see more distant places in the city. For lovers of the night, in the city we have a place called Zona Rosa, where you can find the best clubs, bars and restaurants in the city, and that's where all the people go to celebrate, dance and enjoy.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"description":{"description":"I'm going to tell you a secret, pay attention.
