Imagine the savings you will make right here!\n\nWe let your friends visit you inside Mamallena. Many hostels will only allow paying guests inside. As long as your friends our respectful of the hostel and our other guests, and buy a few drinks from the bar, then they are more than welcome.\n\nOur latest big news is that we have now installed a 100 megabyte fiber optics internet system. It seems to cover all the rooms and so far no complaints, fingers crossed it continues like that!! This is the best internet available in all of Colombia, and now available in Mamallena.\n\nAs a backpacker you choose a hostel for the atmosphere, the value and the information provided to make to make the most of your trip. We have plenty of space to chill and meet others, and just relax in the heat of the day. Our staff can provide all the information you need to know about what to do in Cartagena and how to continue your journey. We can make bookings for buses for onward travel as well as trips to Playa Blanca, Santa Marta/Taganga and boats to Panama if thats where you are heading. If you want a nice little, undiscovered beach town, then also check out our hostel in Rincon del mar, 3 hours from cartagena.\n\nOur standard rooms have private bathrooms and AC(including dorms) and most(but not all) are pretty spacious. We don't consider ourselves a party hostel, but we're not boring either. There's usually something going on in the patio or the bar. Wednesday is party night on Calle Media Luna, right in front of the hostel. It's one of the best nights out in Cartagena and there's usually plenty of people at the hostel enjoying it before heading out.\n\nOur bar is at the front of the hostel and usually open till 1 or 2am. We have a great deal of 2 for 1 drink specials that last all day as well as your normal selection of drinks.\n\nWe also have a guest kitchen, although its kinda small, dont say you weren't warned, Its not our fault, the building was built that way! Feel free to use it when you like, but if its as little under stocked its cause everything was stolen :(\n\nIf you like animals then you'll feel right at home here. We have our resident, and friendly, dog, cats and an apparent constant flow of kittens.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"description":{"description":"At Hostel Mamallena(RNT 27977) we pride ourselves on great customer service and providing a real backpacker experience.
