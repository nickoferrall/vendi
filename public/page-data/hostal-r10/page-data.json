We believe that the best of Bogota is beyond its top sights, and is not tangible, you won’t be able to take a picture of it. It's in the experiences you live, the food you taste, the music you dance, and the stories the streets have to tell about.\n\nThe hostel has 4 shared rooms with special private bunk beds we’ve designed. Each one has its own closed space, a lamp and a plug, a new mattress and pillow and a comforter for the cold nights of Bogota. Also, each shared room has its own private bathroom. We also have 6 private rooms, 4 of them with a private bathroom and each one with a double bed, night table, closet and desk, in case you need to work while you travel. For the common areas, we have a living room with the dining tables, a TV room with a couple of sofas to chill and a huge TV to watch Netflix, YouTube or all the EPL or UCL matches, a cool terrace with hammocks to chill and watch the Capital’s sunset, and a bar on the first floor to take the previos before heading out for all the things Bogota has to offer every night.We have free breakfast! Every day a different menu, with fruits, coffee/tea and a special meal, most of the times a local one.\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"description":{"description":"In R10 you will be at the epicenter of the city, where it all started with its foundation, where we decided to declare our independence, and now where most of the people prepare for the future and make the decisions that will define it. So after living here in La Candelaria for 5 years, and housing exchange students for most of that time, we have found this beautiful building which used to be one of the best hotels of the city, right in the hearth of La Candelaria. We’ve decided to remodel it, and bring life back to it, because life is people."},"facilities":null,"image":[{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.0049875311720697,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/1Qqts5OMLF9Jj3Bf0SsZO4/850d08d9004704ff3a7954d1f14887fa/Screenshot_62.jpg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/1Qqts5OMLF9Jj3Bf0SsZO4/850d08d9004704ff3a7954d1f14887fa/Screenshot_62.jpg?w=200&h=100&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/1Qqts5OMLF9Jj3Bf0SsZO4/850d08d9004704ff3a7954d1f14887fa/Screenshot_62.jpg?w=400&h=200&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/1Qqts5OMLF9Jj3Bf0SsZO4/850d08d9004704ff3a7954d1f14887fa/Screenshot_62.jpg?w=800&h=399&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/1Qqts5OMLF9Jj3Bf0SsZO4/850d08d9004704ff3a7954d1f14887fa/Screenshot_62.jpg?w=804&h=401&q=50 804w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"hostal-r10"}}}
