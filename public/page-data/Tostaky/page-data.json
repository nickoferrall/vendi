Tostaky's first idea is a space that helps people, cultures, music and different flavors meet. Here we gather all nationalities, ages, languages, social classes. The word Tostaky was born from the mouth of the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, and was also the title of a song and an album by the French group Noir Désir. Tostaky is simply the contraction of the phrase \"Everything is Here.\" Its use always refers to solidarity, sharing and a fair and social vision of society. That is why we always work with local people, handle fair prices and support social processes such as the \"foundation à ton étoile\"."},"facilities":null,"image":[{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAYABgAAD/2wBDAAQCAwMDAgQDAwMEBAQEBQkGBQUFBQsICAYJDQsNDQ0LDAwOEBQRDg8TDwwMEhgSExUWFxcXDhEZGxkWGhQWFxb/2wBDAQQEBAUFBQoGBgoWDwwPFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhb/wAARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcCBAUG/8QAKhAAAQMCBAUDBQAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAURAAYhMQcSE0FRFBUiMkNhcYH/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBQb/xAAhEQABAwUAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgQRAAMFIWETQSIx0f/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8At8T8nUml0luG3XIknrFZjvJSB0VXH1EH5a6ajvcDCjzDU6y63l+n1CpMhlcpMFLLf2UqUkBfglRJP5sNtMPnidlSmQ51Cy6XZsliSw84tyRIKikp5UjkGydz28DYWOJxH4I0ym5Up1Rm1uTNR6gSAlDIYcSUglIStJNrcunx74G+zrp08uJcXD6iPoa53c6pOBxiMYxizoGY9kRAkk8EQDquAr4psZimsCOFFEFN9b7qWe/7wYnnttv3RlqOC02xH6YBsokc6yLm3ggfzBiuzfMkWEpSoAdSfytN43KfitQJHK//2Q==","aspectRatio":1.597875569044006,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/4hwxIMMTK28M3LaO6gtVJg/c5161c8bbee5673b3452d32d7020ef7f/Screenshot_155.jpg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/4hwxIMMTK28M3LaO6gtVJg/c5161c8bbee5673b3452d32d7020ef7f/Screenshot_155.jpg?w=200&h=125&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/4hwxIMMTK28M3LaO6gtVJg/c5161c8bbee5673b3452d32d7020ef7f/Screenshot_155.jpg?w=400&h=250&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/4hwxIMMTK28M3LaO6gtVJg/c5161c8bbee5673b3452d32d7020ef7f/Screenshot_155.jpg?w=800&h=501&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/4hwxIMMTK28M3LaO6gtVJg/c5161c8bbee5673b3452d32d7020ef7f/Screenshot_155.jpg?w=1053&h=659&q=50 1053w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"Tostaky"}}}
