This is why we can offer you a great nights sleep, while the party district is only a 5-minute cab ride and the price of a late night slice of pizza away. Ivy offers excellent access to Medellin’s metro system; only a 5-10 minute (and relatively flat) walk to the nearby Aguacatala station will propel you throughout the city to many of the tourist hot spots and local neighborhoods. We’re a 5-minute walk to 2 major grocery stores (one of which is open 24-hours) and 2 major shopping malls, and a 10-minute walk to the EAFIT University language center – the largest in the city (offering 2- and 4-week programs). Additionally, we have convenient access to the growing yet still authentically Colombian sector of Envigado either by foot, taxi, or bus. And if you happen to stay with us over the weekend, don’t forget to take advantage of a “ciclovía,” in which the south-bound lanes of the beautiful Avenida Poblado (located almost next to the hostel) are blocked off to traffic and filled with walkers, joggers, bikers, and the occasional rollerblader. This occurs on most Sundays and “puentes” (one of the numerous Colombian holidays that fall on a Monday).","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"description":{"description":"Ivy is an Australian and American-owned hostel.
