We are a 25 minute walking from town which can be reached at any time and where you can buy all necessary amenities. The hostel lies right between the jungle and the stunning Pacific Ocean. You can therefore walk right onto the beach from hostel or around our garden and surrounding jungle and immerse yourself in the local flora and fauna. We have lots of areas to rest and relax where you can lie back in a hammock and enjoy the sounds (and view!) of the ocean and jungle mixing, creating a unique experience."},"facilities":null,"image":[{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.084862385321101,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/6JGgxmJsfKXURhF6HwODVg/f83e5f52a5436a5207e95191798d346f/Screenshot_17.jpg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/6JGgxmJsfKXURhF6HwODVg/f83e5f52a5436a5207e95191798d346f/Screenshot_17.jpg?w=200&h=96&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/6JGgxmJsfKXURhF6HwODVg/f83e5f52a5436a5207e95191798d346f/Screenshot_17.jpg?w=400&h=192&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/6JGgxmJsfKXURhF6HwODVg/f83e5f52a5436a5207e95191798d346f/Screenshot_17.jpg?w=800&h=384&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/6JGgxmJsfKXURhF6HwODVg/f83e5f52a5436a5207e95191798d346f/Screenshot_17.jpg?w=909&h=436&q=50 909w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"the-pelican-house"}}}
