Casa Cubil is located in a historic building overlooking a charming park in Teusaquillo, a neighbourhood with a conservation designation due to its rich architectural history. Developed in the 1930’s and 1940’s, Teusaquillo was built to house the wealthy Bogotano families of the time and has ever since been characterised by its ample green spaces and proximity to the city center. Previously comprised of haciendas, during the 1930’s the area’s development was movements City Beautiful and City Garden as well as the neo-colonial French and English inspired by the European Urbanism architectural styles of the time. The mostly Neo-Tudor Victorian red brick designs have been preserved to this day and now epitomize Bogota’s classic architecture.\n\nWe have a selection of three private rooms, two of which include en-suite bathrooms. Our master suite in the attic offers a very private setting with a unique décor. Each of our shared rooms offer our signature single and double sized Cubils or Pods, which were designed to provide a private space including a reading lamp, book shelves, charging sockets, a blackout curtain and private storage. Shared bathrooms available to our guests have also been designed to grant maximum privacy by including a shower, toilet, basin and changing area within one enclosed space.\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"description":{"description":"Set in a historic home and neighbourhood, Casa Cubil is a one of a kind design hostel in Bogota where privacy, comfort and decor are paramount.
