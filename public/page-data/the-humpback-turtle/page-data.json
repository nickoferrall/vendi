Since then, we along with the local community have put our hearts and souls into what the Humpback is today.  We offer private rooms, dorm beds, as well as a covered camp site with hammocks and lockers.  Our restaurant serves fresh fish daily, and delicious flavors come from our extensive organic garden.  We have a vibey beach bar, where you can have a cold beer or fruit juice while watching the waves crash.  Everything has been made with natural materials from the region, with palm thatch roofs, tropical hardwood floors, and cane and bamboo walls. As we are right on the beach in front of the Pacific Ocean, the sea breeze keeps nights cool and the verdant jungle the air fresh. Nestled amidst our lush gardens and between 2 streams, the Humpback is your spot from which to explore the beauty of Choco and the magic of the Pacific Coast!."},"facilities":null,"image":[{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.272727272727273,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/2GhDDqK3fa1OwF2FRIqGLP/5e94bcacf25f31857cde962169ce3284/Screenshot_16.jpg?w=800&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/2GhDDqK3fa1OwF2FRIqGLP/5e94bcacf25f31857cde962169ce3284/Screenshot_16.jpg?w=200&h=88&q=50 200w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/2GhDDqK3fa1OwF2FRIqGLP/5e94bcacf25f31857cde962169ce3284/Screenshot_16.jpg?w=400&h=176&q=50 400w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/2GhDDqK3fa1OwF2FRIqGLP/5e94bcacf25f31857cde962169ce3284/Screenshot_16.jpg?w=800&h=352&q=50 800w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/ace5wlgmsuh6/2GhDDqK3fa1OwF2FRIqGLP/5e94bcacf25f31857cde962169ce3284/Screenshot_16.jpg?w=1000&h=440&q=50 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"the-humpback-turtle"}}}
