Our special location gives you the best view of the sprawling city from the bar/rooftop whilst being away from the noisy downtown. On top of this we are just a few blocks away from the main attractions such as the Gold Museum and the main plaza, and you can easily access all of the nightlife and attractions that Bogotá has to offer.\n\nWe claim to have the best beds in Bogotá. All of our beds come with individual lockers, reading lights, privacy curtains and wall sockets for your devices.\n\nOur wealth of resources and weekly schedule will have you cycling through the winding streets of Bogotá, taking in the breathless view from the nearby 3100m Monserrate, meandering through local flea markets, dancing the night away in the nearby salsa clubs, pushing things further with some of the best electronic music in Latin America, and so much more. All tours and activities can be arranged and investigated at our reception.\n\n","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"description":{"description":"BoGo Hostel & Rooftop comes with the only proper rooftop panoramic view from a Hostel in Bogotá, and offers both mixed and female dorms, alongside comfortable private rooms and a shared kitchen.
